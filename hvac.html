            <p class="">Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is designed to achieve the
                environmental requirements of the comfort of occupants and a process. HVAC systems are more used in
                different types of buildings such as industrial, commercial, residential and institutional buildings.
                The main mission of HVAC system is to satisfy the thermal comfort of occupants by adjusting and changing
                the outdoor air conditions to the desired conditions of occupied buildings. Depending on outdoor
                conditions, the outdoor air is drawn into the buildings and heated or cooled before it is distributed
                into the occupied spaces, then it is exhausted to the ambient air or reused in the system. The selection
                of HVAC systems in a given building will depend on the climate, the age of the building, the individual
                preferences of the owner of the building and a designer of a project, the project budget, the
                architectural design of the buildings.
                <br><br>
                HVAC systems can be classified according to necessary processes and distribution process. The required
                processes include the heating process, the cooling process, and ventilation process. Other processes can
                be added such as humidification and dehumidification process. These processes can be achieved by using
                suitable HVAC equipment such as heating systems, air-conditioning systems, ventilation fans, and
                dehumidifiers. The HVAC systems need the distribution system to deliver the required amount of air with
                the desired environmental condition. The distribution system mainly varies according to the refrigerant
                type and the delivering method such as air handling equipment, fan coils, air ducts, and water pipes.

            <h4 style="font-size: 26px;font-weight:bold" class="display-6">How do a Chiller Work?</h4>
            <p class="">A chiller works on the principle of vapor compression or vapor absorption. Chillers provide
                a continuous flow of coolant to the cold side of a process water system at a desired temperature of
                about 50°F (10°C). The coolant is then pumped through the process, extracting heat out of one area of a
                facility (e.g., machinery, process equipment, etc.) as it flows back to the return side of the process
                water system.
                <br><br>
                A chiller uses a vapor compression mechanical refrigeration system that connects to the process water
                system through a device called an evaporator. Refrigerant circulates through an evaporator, compressor,
                condenser and expansion device of a chiller. A thermodynamic process occurs in each of above components
                of a chiller. The evaporator functions as a heat exchanger such that heat captured by the process
                coolant flow transfers to the refrigerant. As the heat-transfer takes place, the refrigerant evaporates,
                changing from a low-pressure liquid into vapor, while the temperature of the process coolant reduces.
                <br><br>
                The refrigerant then flows to a compressor, which performs multiple functions. First, it removes
                refrigerant from the evaporator and ensures that the pressure in the evaporator remains low enough to
                absorb heat at the correct rate. Second, it raises the pressure in outgoing refrigerant vapor to ensure
                that its temperature remains high enough to release heat when it reaches the condenser. The refrigerant
                returns to a liquid state at the condenser. The latent heat given up as the refrigerant changes from
                vapor to liquid is carried away from the environment by a cooling medium (air or water).

            <h4 style="font-size: 26px;font-weight:bold" class="display-6 mb-3">Types of Chillers</h4>
            <h5>Water Cooled Chiller</h5>
            <p class="">Water-cooled chillers feature a water-cooled condenser connected with a cooling tower. They have
                commonly been used for medium and large installations that have a sufficient water supply. Water-cooled
                chillers can produce more constant performance for commercial and industrial air conditioning because of
                the relative independence to fluctuations of the ambient temperature. Water-cooled chillers range in
                size from small 20-ton capacity models to several thousand-ton models that cool the world’s largest
                facilities such as airports, shopping malls and other facilities.
                <br><br>
                A typical water-cooled chiller uses recirculating condenser water from a cooling tower to condense the
                refrigerant. A water-cooled chiller contains a refrigerant dependent on the entering condenser water
                temperature (and flow rate), which functions in relation to the ambient wet-bulb temperature. Since the
                wet-bulb temperature is always lower than the dry-bulb temperature, the refrigerant condensing
                temperature (and pressure) in a water-cooled chiller can often operate significantly lower than an
                air-cooled chiller. Thus, water-cooled chillers can operate more efficiently.
                <br><br>
                Water-cooled chillers typically reside indoors in an environment protected from the elements. Hence,
                water-cooled chiller can offer a longer lifespan. Water-cooled chillers typically represent the only
                option for larger installations. The additional cooling tower system will require additional
                installation expense and maintenance as compared to air-cooled chillers.

            </div>
            <h5>Air Cooled Chiller</h5>
            <p class="">Air-cooled chillers rely on a condenser cooled by the environment air. Thus, air-cooled chillers
                may find common application in smaller or medium installations where space constraints may exist. An
                air-cooled chiller can represent the most practical choice in scenarios where water represents a scarce
                resource.
                <br><br>
                A typical air-cooled chiller can feature propeller fans or mechanical refrigeration cycles to draw
                ambient air over a finned coil to condense the refrigerant. The condensation of the refrigerant vapor in
                the air-cooled condenser enables the transfer of heat to the atmosphere.
                <br><br>
                Air-cooled chillers offer the significant advantage of lower installation costs. Simpler maintenance
                also results due to their relative simplicity as compared to water-cooled chillers. Air-cooled chillers
                will occupy less space, but will mostly reside outside a facility. Thus, the outdoor elements will
                compromise their functional lifespan.
                <br><br>
                The all-inclusive nature of air-cooled chillers reduces maintenance costs. Their relative simplicity
                coupled with reduced space requirements produces great advantages in many types of installations.
